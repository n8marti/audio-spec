# Audio Spectrogram

Create a spectrogram from most type of audio files.

The script requires [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to be installed, as well as the packages found in requirements.txt:

```shell
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Once installed, make sure to add the script to your path. After this, you can create a spectrogram from the command line by running:

```shell
$ audiospec.py myAudioFile.wav
```
